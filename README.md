# Plotly_Analysis

## Overview of Analysis
In this analysis we learn the skills needed to create interactive data visualizations with Plotly and JavaScript. We use the basics of Plotly and create various types of charts, as well as manipulate data using JavaScript. We also learned how to use event listeners to create interactivity in her visualizations. Creating a dynamic chart with a dropdown menu is a key skill that will be helpful in creating a dashboard for the volunteers to view. We are able to create more advanced and customized visualizations using JavaScript to display more information to our audience effectively.
