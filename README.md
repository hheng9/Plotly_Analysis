# Plotly_Analysis

## Overview of Analysis
In this analysis we learn the skills needed to create interactive data visualizations with Plotly and JavaScript. We then use the basics of Plotly and create various types of charts as well as manipulate data using JavaScript. Learning how to use event listeners helps us create interactivity within the visualizations. Creating a dynamic chart with a dropdown menu is a key skill that will be helpful in creating a dashboard for the volunteers to view. Plotly and JavaScript gives us the ability to create more advanced and customized visualizations to display more information to our audience effectively.
